\subsection{Multiple Linear Regression to Predict CPU Clock Speed}
The main objective of this section is constructing a model that portrays the effect of other variables on the Processor Base Frequency. To achieve this we applied a Multi Regression model, in which the dependent variable is Processor Base Frequency, while the rest are independent. Our model comes in this form:

%ai thêm giùm cái pt regression nha :3

We start with our first model, also known as the base model, where it will be built with all the independent variables available.

%ảnh model 2

In this model, our independent variables consist of:
